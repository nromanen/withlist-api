# Alembic Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by **Alembic**.

- All migration files are stored in `versions/`.
- Do not remove or rename migration files once committed.

## Usage

**Create a new migration:**
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe changes"
```

**Apply latest migrations:**
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

**Downgrade one step:**
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Notes

- Database URL is read from `.env` file via `env.py` and `database.py`.
- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying them.
- Keep migration history consistent across environments.
